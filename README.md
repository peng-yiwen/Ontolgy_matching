# Ontology_matching

This repository contains our implementation of the ontology matching framework in paper: **Ontology Matching using Textual Class Descriptions**

### Getting Started

- To install dependencies, please run:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Data resources:
    - All the data used can be found in data directory.
    - The data_script directory contains a Jupyter notebook detailing how we crawled the data, cleaned it, and converted it to OAEI standard format.
- Evaluate TEXTO matching system on different dataset: run directly main.ipynb file, remember to change the data_path to corresponding dataset
