# Ontology_matching

This repository contains our implementation of the ontology matching framework in paper: **Ontology Matching using Textual Class Descriptions**

# Getting Started

- To install dependencies, please run:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Data resources:
    - All the data used can be found in [data](https://github.com/peng-yiwen/Ontolgy_matching/tree/main/data) directory.
    - The [data_script](https://github.com/peng-yiwen/Ontolgy_matching/tree/main/data_script) directory contains a Jupyter notebook detailing how we crawled the data, cleaned it, and converted it to OAEI standard format.
- To evaluate the TEXTO matching system on different datasets:
  **run directly main.ipynb file, remember to change the data_path to corresponding dataset**
